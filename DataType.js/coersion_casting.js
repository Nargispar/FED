//   Type conversion
//   there are two types of conversion
//   1) Explicit conversion  2) Implicit conversion
//   Explicit => the conversion which is done through the developers(expert) is called conversion or we can say it TYPE CASTING.
//   Implicit => the conversion which is done by the javascript automatically is called Implicit conversion ....we can say it also TYPE COERCION.


// DIFF BETWEEN == & ===
// (==) :-  This compare only value.
//			eg = 2 == '2'  return TRUE;
//          There type coercion is happening
//          it convert (string)'2' into a (number) 2 then it compare and give true result.


// (===) :-  This compare value and data type as well.
//			eg = 2 === '2'  return FALSE;
//          There type coercion is not happening
